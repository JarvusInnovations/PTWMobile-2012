			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="wp-image-15849 alignright" title="ptw_large_att_vertical" src="http://technicallyphilly.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/ptw_large_att_vertical.jpg" alt="" width="115" height="126" />And now for a bit of a public service announcement.</p>
<p>As Philly Tech Week matures, Technically Philly is often faced with issues that we never even fathomed when creating the event. This year&#8217;s Philly Tech Week doubled the total amount of attendees from last year, and with a bigger tent comes a more diverse community. For the first time, Philly Tech Week fielded requests for sign language interpretation across several events, over 34 hours total across the week.</p>
<p>These requests were unexpected and with the help of the community we ended up being able to provide assistance at every event requested, a feat only made possible by some generous community members that we&#8217;d like to thank.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://philadelphiagamelab.org/">Philadelphia Game Lab </a>- With only a few days notice, the folks at PGL pitched in to cover partial costs of an interpreter at its day-long &#8220;Gamification for Non-Profits&#8221; conference.</li>
<li><a href="http://planphilly.org">PlanPhilly and PennPraxis</a> &#8211; The design and development news site covered the cost of interpretation at their Lunchtime Series event.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.apprenaissance.com/">AppRenaissance</a> &#8211; The Old City development firm graciously supported 14 hours of total interpretation across the week.</li>
<li>Thanks to interpreter Brandi Chittum for helping us coordinate.</li>
</ul>
<p>In tech, we commonly use the word &#8220;accessibility&#8221; when discussing issues of the digital divide. However, true accessibility means everyone has access to the resources and people in this wonderful technology community. Thanks to all the event organizers that worked with PTW organizers to fulfill often last-munite interpretation requests.</p>
<p>A special thanks to Bob Moul for graciously volunteering AppRenaissance&#8217;s resources to ensure that everyone could enjoy the second annual Philly Tech Week. If you&#8217;d like to sponsor ASL-certified interpreters for the 2013 Philly Tech Week, <a href="mailto:info@technicallyphilly.com">please let us know</a>.</p>

<p>Huntingdon Valley-based email marketing company AWeber Communications aimed to put on display its 40 person development team during the second annual <a href="http://PhillyTechWeek.com">Philly Tech Week</a> presented by AT&amp;T.</p>
<p>As a member of the Greater Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce, Aweber staff took root in a Chamber conference room on South Broad Street to host two conversations on its work, followed by a Happy Hour at Center Ciy microbrewery Nodding Head. Fortunately, the firm filmed both presentations.</p>
<p>[Full Disclosure: Aweber was also a Philly Tech Week sponsor.]</p>
<p>First, above, marketing manager Nick Moore <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14312axyGPQ&amp;feature=youtu.be">talks</a> to 20 attendees about how AWeber has focused on &#8216;return on integration,&#8217; or funding its application development. Next, below, Ethan McCreadie and Philip Cristiano discuss with 35 attendees AWeber&#8217;s use of Japanese project management system <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban">Kanban</a>.</p>

<p>Entrepreneurship and investment need not be inextricably linked.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s something of the bailiwick of Mike Krupit, the seasoned suburban entrepreneur who is now the general manager of Langhorne-based incubator Novotorium.</p>
<p>Krupit kicked off <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Philadelphia-Bootstrappers-Breakfast-Group/">the Philadelphia Boostrappers Breakfast</a> with a chatty group of 30 entrepreneurs at Elephant and Castle in Center City during Philly Tech Week. The meetup will take place the fourth Tuesday of every month &#8212; <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Philadelphia-Bootstrappers-Breakfast-Group/">next time will be May 22</a> &#8212; and the first had a waiting list, so get it on your calendar.</p>
<p><span id="more-15661"></span></p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re hear to learn and share and celebrate growing business in a more organic way,&#8221; said Krupit, in a clever turn of phrase for a longtime vegan. Krupit had help in the organization, primarily his Novotorium manager Chuck Hall.</p>
<p>Join the Philadelphia Meetup group <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Philadelphia-Bootstrappers-Breakfast-Group/">here</a>. Visit the national group page <a href="http://www.bootstrappersbreakfast.com/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Started in San Francisco in 2003, Philadelphia is the eighth branded chapter, just the fourth outside of California, but the concept is surely straightforward. Whether it&#8217;s the nature of the business you&#8217;re in or your own personal tastes, a crew of entrepreneurs grab breakfast together to talk through challenges and find common ground around scaling a business to profitability without outside investment.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of entrepreneurs learn on their third or fourth business that venture capital isn&#8217;t always the right fit,&#8221; Krupit said. &#8220;We hope to show more people that there are alternatives.&#8221;</p>

<p>More than 40 developers and journalists worked on tools that had a mobile focus and a news spirit. The hackathon happened conterminously with BCNI, which welcomed 120 reporters and news media thinkers from throughout the East Coast.</p>
<p>Check out the participants below and photos of the event on Facebook <a href="http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.450797294937464.125003.193906323959897&amp;type=1">here</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-15641"></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FIRST PLACE: Sheltr.org mobile add on</strong> by Adam Hinz gives more flexibility to the already popular hackathon project.</li>
<li><strong>SECOND PLACE (tie): LGBTRights.me</strong> led by Philadelphia Gay News Editor Sarah Blazucki, with activist Faye Anderson, Comcast developer Mike Ball, Indy Hall&#8217;s Bula, Gabriel Farrell, Daniel Freiman, Casey Thomas and Code for America fellow Alex Yule, conveys how varied LGBT rights are by comparing by location. Visit it <a href="http://LGBTRights.me">here</a>.</li>
<li><strong>SECOND PLACE (tie): Switchboard</strong>: This mass survey tool was aimed at collecting information from taxi drivers but can have other application, says the original pitch from Bryan Mercer at the Media Mobilizing Project and Ron Blount of the Taxi Workers Alliance of Pennsylvania. The development team, which took on the hard work of building the thing, included Josh Marcus, and Bennet Huber of Azavea, Dan Feder and Bryan Purcell. Find the project GitHub <a href="http://github.com/switchboard/switchboard">here</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Text Blast</strong>: The mass text-message information tool by Tim Wisniewski will help civic groups mobilize. Visit it <a href="http://textblast.org/">here</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Money Talks</strong>: Focusing on the withering local campaign finance data from Our Philadelphia, journalists <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/tom-ferrick/4/b68/a5a">Tom Ferrick</a> and Chris Brennan partnered with Comcast developer Karl Martino, Inquirer data visualization specialist Rob Kandell and Kristen Mosbrucker to collaborate on some data.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.councilmatic.org/">Councilmatic</a>:</strong> The more flexible City Council legislation tool from Mjumbe Poe gained some ground.</li>
</ul>
<p>BCNI was sponsored by the <a href="http://www.cpijournalism.org/">Center for Public Interest Journalism</a> and hosted by Temple University. The hackathon was sponsored by Tropo, which offered SMS tech support for two of the projects. Technically Philly organized both events.</p>
<p>The winners will be receiving a prize pack thanks to support from CPIJ.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://bcniphilly.com/2012/04/21/why-and-how-the-open-gov-news-hackathon-is-being-judged-3000-in-prizes/">projects were judged</a> by Mark Headd of Code for America, who <a href="http://civic.io/2012/05/02/philly-tech-week-hackathon-recap/">wrote about the effort</a>, Clinton Johnson of the City of Philadelphia, Erika Owens of Hacks/Hackers and also <a href="http://bcniphilly.com/2012/04/21/dan-schultz-of-truthgoggles-and-amy-gahran-of-oaklandlocal-com-2012-attendee-highlight/">Amy Gahran of Oakland Local and Dan Schultz of Truth Goggles</a>.</p>

<p>Five Frankford residents completed a three-day computer literacy certification program hosted during Philly Tech Week in partnership between state Rep. Tony Payton and the Frankford CDC.</p>
<p>The five residents celebrated with a small graduation ceremony last Thursday. The residents who completed the course were the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ethel Dawson</li>
<li>Frank Cutler</li>
<li>Karen Lee</li>
<li>Rasheem Jennings</li>
<li>William Brown</li>
</ul>
<p>Among the topics learned over three days, attendees got a taste of basic computer comfort, common web tools, social networking communication and the use of email.</p>
<p>20-something Jennings was most excited to learn how to upload a resume.</p>
<p>&#8220;All the job applications I find want me to give a resume online, but I didn&#8217;t know how to do that until this class,&#8221; said Jennings.</p>
<p>Brown told Technically Philly he was excited to better communicate through Facebook and email.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I know what a &#8216;wall&#8217; is,&#8221; he said, laughing.</p>
<p>In January, the Frankford CDC opened up <a href="http://frankfordgazette.com/2012/04/29/frankord-gazette-interview-with-the-frankford-cdc-part-2/">10 computer workstations for residents</a>. The computer lab came through a partnership with the city&#8217;s collaborative PhillyRising effort, Temple&#8217;s Computer Recycling Center and Aria Health, which operates the formerly named Frankford Hospital across the street.</p>
<p>&#8220;The CDC definitely plans on doing further workshops, thanks to the People&#8217;s Emergency Center,&#8221; said CDC spokeswoman Michelle Feldman. &#8220;We don&#8217;t have any dates set, but folks can give us a call at 215-743-6580 for more info.&#8221;</p>
<p>The event, coordinated with Technically Philly, was a pilot for future Tech Week events that will offer basic computer literacy training, something that senior centers, libraries and other community groups do independently throughout the city.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s great to get our part of the city involved in Tech Week,&#8221; said Rep. Payton. &#8220;We were proud to be a part.&#8221;</p>

<p>Entrepreneurship is hard, regardless of color, <a href="http://www.definedclarity.com/">Defined Clarity</a> cofounder and CMO Bruce Marable reminded those gathered at WHYY for the fourth Philly Tech Week Lunchtime Series event, &#8220;WHAT IT TAKES To Be a Black Tech Entrepreneur.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite the challenges the four panelists mentioned, many of the approximately 100 people in attendance raised their hands when asked if they wanted to become an entrepreneur.</p>
<p>Temple University professor and Director of STEM education, outreach, and research Jamie Bracey deftly moderated the panel of Philadelphia entrepreneurs, which included Interactive One CTO Navarrow Wright, Angel Venture Forum Managing Partner and Mataron Development Managing Director Marc Mathis, Marable, and <a href="http://technicallyphilly.com/2012/04/03/dean-harris-award-winning-local-technologist-teaching-computer-science-to-philly-high-schoolers">award-winning technologist Dean Harris</a>, as they debated the challenges that face black entrepreneurs in the technology field.</p>

<p>Mathis stepped in to replace DreamIT Ventures Managing Director William Crowder who could not make the lunchtime panel discussion.</p>
<p>The panel discussion ranged from learning how to personally identify as an entrepreneur to being clear about the motivation for your business to mentorship.</p>
<p>Wright made an impassioned argument for why motivation matters when you are an entrepreneur.</p>
<p>&#8220;The reality is, as any of my colleagues can tell you, if you become an entrepreneur for the sole focus of getting money or making money, you&#8217;re going to lose,&#8221; said Wright.</p>
<p>You can see him make his case for below:</p>

<p>What IT Takes is an organization that connects young black males with high profile black male mentors and role models.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://technicallyphilly.com/2012/04/27/planphilly-kerkstra-demos-property-tax-delinquency-app-says-philly-is-worst-in-the-country/planphilly-tax-delinquency-audience-ptw" rel="attachment wp-att-15561"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-15561" title="PlanPhilly Tax Delinquency Audience PTW" src="http://technicallyphilly.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/PlanPhilly-Tax-Delinquency-Audience-PTW-420x315.jpg" alt="" width="420" height="315" /></a></p>
<p>Philadelphia has the worst property tax delinquency problem among big cities in the country.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what freelance journalist and former Inquirer City Hall reporter Patrick Kerkstra told an audience of about 60 people who gathered at <a href="http://whyy.org/">WHYY</a> as he demonstrated the <a href="http://planphilly.com/tax-delinquent-properties">tax delinquency web application</a> he helped create to document the issue. He says there are more than 100,000 records of tax delinquent properties.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are many blocks in the city where the vast majority of properties are tax delinquent,&#8221; Kerkstra said, at the Philly Tech Week event, which included a panel discussion.</p>
<p><a href="http://planphilly.com/tax-delinquent-properties"><strong>Visit the application here.</strong></a></p>
<p><span id="more-15560"></span></p>
<p>The core reason for the problem, Kerkstra and other panel members explained, goes something like this: the City of Philadelphia, with a high rate of low-income and elderly homeowners, has focused on wage and business taxes more than other cities, while keeping property taxes much lower. Because of the relatively smaller revenue windfall from property tax revenue, the City of Philadelphia has focused its resources elsewhere.</p>
<p>But Kerkstra made clear during his presentation that properties with back taxes are more likely to be a source of blight, crime and decay.</p>
<p>Or, more pragmatically, as panel member and eConsult vice president <a href="http://twitter.com//status/"><strong></strong> tweeted:</a><blockquote></blockquote>: there are only four things you can tax in this world &#8212; people, income, business and property &#8212; and only one of them can&#8217;t move</p>
<p>The application maps city records on tax property delinquency dating back several decades. The app was created by a partnership between <a href="http://planphilly.com/">PlanPhilly</a> and the Philadelphia Inquirer.</p>
<p>The property tax delinquency app was originally released as part of an <a href="http://planphilly.com/series/philadelphias-tax-delinquency-conundrum">award-winning series</a> that ran in the Inquirer. The project launched last fall, but the effort and reporting has continued.</p>
<p>You can see Kerkstra demonstrate the delinquency app below, which he says offers a sense of the scale of the problem:</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/2oeo3lhE80Q" frameborder="0" width="420" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p>Kerkstra then joined a panel discussion, which included Inquirer assistant multimedia projects editor Rob Kandel, EConsult Corporation vice president Kevin Gillen, Inquirer City Editor Julie Busby, to take questions from moderator, Matt Golas, PlanPhilly&#8217;s managing editor, as well as the audience.</p>
<p>The demo and panel Q&amp;A was organized by PlanPhilly in conjunction with the Philly Tech Week lunchtime series.</p>
