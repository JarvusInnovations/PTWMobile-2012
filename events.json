Yet designing for these experiences can prove a bit tricky and offer up a range of new user behaviors, interface challenges and expectations. Designers coming to touch from web-design often need to shift their mindset to do away with rollovers and embrace the gesture and swipe.\n\nIn this session Bluecadet will go behind the scenes on a range of touch based projects. These may include a native iPhone app for Mural Arts, an iPad Timeline app for the American Revolution Center, an iPad app for the world famous photographer  Steve McCurry and a series of touch-table installations for the Battle of New Orleans Museum, the Penn Museum's Maya 2012 show and the new Ben Franklin Museum at Franklin Court. The last one involves using a new 32 point multi-touch surface to create a playable Glass Armonica. We\u2019ve invited The Hacktory to contribute to the conversation about physical computing and how to engage the museum crowd from their recent experience designing installations for the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. \n\nWe may also preview a new, currently tightly under wraps, touch interface that involves a 15' touch surface in a very, very public space.\n\nThis session is geared towards designers as well as anyone interested in the process and strategy that goes into creating visually rich and intuitive touch interfaces.","Address":"1011 N.
